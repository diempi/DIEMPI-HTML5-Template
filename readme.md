# DIEMPI HTML5 Template 
HTML5 Template inspired by the amazing <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com" title="Check out HTML5 Boilerplate Website">HTML5 boilerplate</a>. I just added some metas that I often use in the header. I also tweak a little bit the default and error pages. I will imrpove it often to get a great template, feel free to use it, fork it and improve it.
Thanks,
